    <h2>Rethinking UGC at the ABC</h2>
    <h3>Presented with Scott Burns at UX Australia 2021</h3>
    <p>
      Gathering user generated content (UGC) has never been easier. But learning
      how to manage and convert this data into measurable value is another
      thing. Central to the ABCâ€™s mission is to inform, entertain, and reflect
      the cultural diversity of the Australian community. UGC is one way of
      achieving this, but it requires a hybrid UX/product/tech/journalistic
      approach. Working in a multi-disciplinary environment comes with its own
      complexities, but when pulled off has high rewards. In this session we
      unpack the techniques we are using, the lessons we are learning along the
      way, and what comes next for UGC at the ABC.
